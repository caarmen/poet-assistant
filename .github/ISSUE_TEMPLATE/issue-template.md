Required before filing an issue:

I am a:

- [ ] Real user of Poet Assistant
- [ ] Student or researcher
- [ ] Reporting an issue found by a software analysis or automation tool
- [ ] Other: Please explain

<!--
Please note that Poet Assistant is in maintenance mode now. I update it about once a year, just to add support for the latest Android version, so the app can remain visible on the Google Play store. I am currently investing my hobby developer time on other projects, and do not have time to allocate to developing, reviewing, or integrating new features to Poet Assistant. Thank you for your understanding.
